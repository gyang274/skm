\usage{
skm_mlp_cpp(x, k, s_must, max_it, max_at)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an m x n matrix often m < n, as a convention index rows of x with s, and
cols of x with t so x(i, j) can be expressed as (s_i, t_j) equally.}

\item{k}{number of index to be selected from x row index start from 0.}

\item{s_must}{an index vector set should be selected before selecting other index.}

\item{max_it}{max number of iterations can run for optimizing result.
max number of iterations within a single initial run on optimal path.}

\item{max_at}{max number of attempts or repeats on running for optimial results,
max number of random initialization for finding optimial results.}
